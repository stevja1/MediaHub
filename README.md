# Objective
Build a feature rich, on-premise implementation of popular cloud services like Google Music, Flickr, Gmail, Google Docs,
and Dropbox.

# Motivations
* Open source allows open modifications
* The ability to actually have literal control of your media
* Reduced lag and bandwidth use

# Current Goals
The current goal is to simply replace Google Music/iTunes Cloud/Amazon Cloud Player with something I can host at home.

The reasons I started are:
* Amazon started dropping MP3s that I purchased and stored in their cloud. This made it impossible for me to get
access to the media that I PAID MONEY FOR. Luckily, I had also uploaded my music to Google Music and also had a local
backup. Its annoying though when a song you want isn't available.
* I hate waiting hours for my music to upload.
* Finally, there are features in the players that I'd like to add. For example, it would be really great to be able to
store and listen to my music in a format other than MP3, (say a lossless FLAC format, for example). There are
JavaScript and native libraries for playing FLAC, but popular players usually only support MP3 or their own special
format.
